# Write a function that calculates the total price of an order and returns it. The function should receive one of
# the following products: "coffee", "coke", "water", or "snacks", and a quantity of the product. The prices for
# a single piece of each product are:
# 路 coffee - 1.50
# 路 water - 1.00
# 路 coke - 1.40
# 路 snacks - 2.00
# Print the result formatted to the second decimal place.
