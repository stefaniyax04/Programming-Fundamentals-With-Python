1. What is a data type?
    * A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of operations can be applied
      to it
    * In Python we have the following data types:
        - Numeric Types: int, float, complex, decimal
        - Text Type: str
        - List, Set, Tuple, Dictionary
        - Boolean
    a) Data Types are Dynamic
        * Python is a dynamic language
        * Variables are not directly associated with any particular value type
        * Any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types
    b) Check the Type of a Variable
        * The type() function helps you find the type of the variable
        * The isinstance() function checks if the specified object is of the specified type

2. Strings
    a) What is a string?
        * Used to represent textual data
        * Each element in the String occupies a position in the String
        * The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on
        * The length of a String is the number of elements in it
    b) String Literal
        * String literals in Python are surrounded by either single quotation marks or double quotation marks:
          'hello' is the same as "hello"
        * The len() method returns the length of a string
    c) Strings are Immutable
        * Unlike in languages like C, Python strings are immutable
        * This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it
    d) String Interpolation
        * These are string literals that allow embedded expressions

3. Numbers
    a) Integers
        * Int or integer is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length
        * Python integers are immutable
    b) Float
        * Float is a floating-point real number, positive or negative, written with a decimal point dividing the
          integer and fractional parts, of unlimited length
        * Python floats are immutable

4. Booleans
    a) What is a Boolean?
        * Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values : True and False
        * You can use the bool() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true
    b) Comparisons and Conditions
        * == - equals
        * != - not equal
        * < - less than
        * <= - less than or equal
        * > - greater than
        * >= - greater than or equal
        * in - item in sequence

5. Additional Datatypes
    a) List
        * A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets
    b) Tuple
        * A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python, tuples are written with round brackets
    c) Set
        * A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. Sets are written with curly brackets.
    d) Dictionary
        * A dictionary is a collection that is ordered, changeable, and indexed. They have value and key.

6. None keyword
    a) What is None?
        * The None keyword is used to define a null value or no value at all
        * There are two ways to check if a variable is None :
            - One way can be performed by using the is keyword
            - Another is using the == syntax
