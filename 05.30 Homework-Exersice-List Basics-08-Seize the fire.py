# The group of adventurists has gone on their first task. Now they should walk through fire - literally.
# They should use all the water they have left. Your task is to help them survive.
#
# Create a program that calculates the water needed to put out a "fire cell", based on the given
# information about its "fire level" and how much it gets affected by water.
#
# First, you will be given the level of fire inside the cell with the integer value of the cell,
# which represents the needed water to put out the fire. They will be given in the following format:
#
# "{typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}#{typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}# â€¦ {typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}"
#
# Afterward, you will receive the amount of water you have for putting out the fires. There is a range
# of fire for each fire type, and if a cell's value is below or exceeds it, it is invalid, and you do not
# need to put it out.
